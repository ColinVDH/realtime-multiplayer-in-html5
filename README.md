Realtime multiplayer in the browser
=============================

:warning: Work in progress

This is a fork of [realtime-multiplayer-in-html5](https://github.com/underscorediscovery/realtime-multiplayer-in-html5), the source code
that is referenced to in [this article](http://buildnewgames.com/real-time-multiplayer/).

To get a better understaning of the realtime concept, I refactored the code in my own style.
I added some new functionalities (and removed some).

## Usage

Run the server (will run on `http://localhost:4004`): 

```
npm start
```

Run the client (will run on `http://localhost:8080`):

```
npm run client
```
